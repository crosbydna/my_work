         <h1>Characters from the Tempest</h1>

         <dl>
            <dt id="cast1">Prospero
            <dd>The play's protagonist and Miranda's father. Usurped and exiled by his 
             brother Antonio, the duke of Milan.</dd>


            <dt id="cast2">Miranda
            <dd>Prospero's daughter, whom he brought with him to the island when she was still 
                a small child. Miranda has never seen any men other than her father and Caliban.</dd>


            <dt id="cast3">Ariel
            <dd>Prospero's spirit helper, a powerful supernatural being whom Prospero controls 
                completely. Rescued by Prospero from a long imprisonment (within a tree) at the 
                hands of the witch Sycorax.</dd>


           <dt id="cast4">Caliban
           <dd>Another of Prospero's servants. Caliban, the son of the now-deceased witch Sycorax, 
               acquainted Prospero with the island when Prospero arrived.</dd>

           <dt id="cast5">Ferdinand
           <dd>Son and heir of Alonso, the King of Naples. He falls in love with Miranda and happily 
               submits to servitude in order to win her father's approval.</dd>


           <dt id="cast6">Alonso
           <dd>King of Naples and father of Ferdinand. Alonso aided Antonio in unseating Prospero 
               as duke of Milan twelve years earlier.</dd>


           <dt id="cast7">Antonio
           <dd>Prospero's thoroughly wicked brother who betrayed Prospero's trust and stole his 
               dukedom years before the play begins.</dd>


           <dt id="cast8">Sebastian
           <dd>Alonso's brother. Like Antonio, Sebastian is wicked and underhanded.</dd>


           <dt id="cast9">Gonzalo
           <dd>An old, honest lord. The goodhearted Gonzalo helped Prospero and Miranda to escape 
               and survive after Antonio usurped Prospero's title.</dd>


           <dt id="cast10">Trinculo
           <dd>A jester, who provides comic relief along with Stefano.</dd>


           <dt id="cast11">Stefano
           <dd>A drunken butler who provides comic relief along with Trinculo.</dd>


           <dt id="cast12">Adrian
           <dd>A lord attending King Alonso of Naples.</dd>


           <dt id="cast13">Francisco
           <dd>A lord attending King Alonso of Naples.</dd>
